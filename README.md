# EzEdgeAI  
  
> Since this project is still in the early development stage, I will try to implement different applications for study.  
> The version that previously implemented "Edge Impulse for Linux" Python SDK on the Raspberry Pi 4 is in the "[concept](https://github.com/on-device-ai/EzEdgeAI/tree/concept)" branch.  
> The version that previously implemented Edge TPU (Coral) object detection inference is in the "[coral](https://github.com/on-device-ai/EzEdgeAI/tree/coral)" branch.  
  
This project uses the "Low Code/No Code" approach to build a deep learning development environment for Edge AI or On-Device AI. It includes a component-based framework and a flow-based visual programming editor. The concept is as follows:
