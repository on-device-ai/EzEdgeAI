# EzEdgeAI  
  
This project uses the "Low Code/No Code" approach to build a deep learning development environment for Edge AI or On-Device AI. It includes a component-based framework and a flow-based visual programming editor. Please refer to the main branch's [README.md](https://github.com/on-device-ai/EzEdgeAI/blob/main/README.md) for the concept of the project's architecture.  
This branch attempts to implement TinyML or TFLite Micro development environments. It will integrate with previously developed TinyML related projects such as [OpenM1](https://github.com/on-device-ai/OpenM1), [McuML](https://github.com/on-device-ai/McuML), [tflite-micro-compiler](https://github.com/on-device-ai/tflite-micro-compiler), etc.  
Use the [ClassifyHeartbeats](https://github.com/on-device-ai/ClassifyHeartbeats) project as an example to demonstrate the TinyML development process and deploy the final output to the STM32F746 Discovery kit.
